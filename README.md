# compact-searchable-multi-select2
  
Select2 is a very modular select box. Needed a quick replacement for an existing bootstrap-select plugin in a project while transitioning over to bootstrap v5.  
This example uses a customized selectionAdapter, resultsAdapter and some custom config options to achive a very similar UI/UX.  Only tested with select2 v4.0.13.
